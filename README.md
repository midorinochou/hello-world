rainbows, unicorns, muffins and cakes for life!!!

So one day the one legged monkey decided he's had enough and decided he will climb a tree.
Not just any tree though.
No, no, he had his eye on this massive boab tree at the end of the forest.
Why that one, you ask?

It was where Kanako lived.


ANd he need to see her. He had something he wanted to say to her.
